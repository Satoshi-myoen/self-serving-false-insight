## Reproducibility and Open Science Statement

This repository accompanies the manuscript:

"The Insight That Flatters: A Computational Mechanism for Self-Serving False Insights"

### Current Status
- This repository is intentionally minimal at the time of submission.
- All analyses reported in the manuscript were conducted prior to submission.

### Data
- All datasets used in the paper are publicly available:
  - Danek & Wiley (2017)
  - Webb et al. (2018)
  - Bilalić et al. (2008, 2010)
- No proprietary or private data were used.

### Analysis and Parameters
- Model structure and parameters are fully specified in the manuscript and Supplement.
- No post-hoc parameter tuning was conducted after model comparison.
- Cross-validation procedures are explicitly described in the Supplement.

### Code Release Plan
- Analysis scripts and model code will be released upon:
  - acceptance of the manuscript, or
  - completion of anonymized refactoring (if required by journal policy).

This staged release follows standard open-science practice and ensures full reproducibility.
